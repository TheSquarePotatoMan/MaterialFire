# MaterialFire
+ Menu button now available but still replacable with overflow button
+ As clean and fluid a material UI as I could make it (still working on more improvements though!)
+ Edits and adds animations to all tabs, searchbars and buttons(though some currently still have their original background)

### notes 
+ Tested with Firefox 66 on Windows 10.
+ Some custom themes from the store edit this theme's files and some add-ons might conflict with it.

### How to apply
+ Type 'about:profiles' in the Firefox urlbar and hit enter
+ Open the root directory folder of your profile
+ Open the 'chrome' folder, or create it if it doesn't exist
+ Copy the file 'chrome.css'(or its contents if you already have a chrome.css file), the 'movablemenubutton.uc.jc' and the folder 'material' into the chrome folder
+ Restart Firefox

### What I'm hoping to add in the future
+ resizing back button to be the same size as the forward button in all modes
+ removing background or replacing buttons 
+ expandable/scrollable bookmarkbar(I'm a complete coding noob though, so this might take a while)
+ Some button replacements

ps contributions are very much appreciated! :)
