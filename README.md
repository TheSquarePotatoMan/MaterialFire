# MaterialFire
+ Removes scrollbar, menu button, page action button and full screen animation
+ Overflow button is used as a 'replacement' for the menu button
+ Replaces some icons and adds animations to all buttons, the tabs and the urlbar

### notes 
Tested with Firefox 66 on Windows 10.
Custom themes and add-ons can change this theme.
Sometimes there's a glitch where the navbar becomes completely unresponsive to mouse hovers and clicks and you will (usually) need to restart Firefox.
